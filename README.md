# Framecoin - Inframe Token Launchpad

Framecoin lets you launch your token from within a Farcaster Frame - tradable directly without needing to have pre-seeded liquidity thanks to it's built in pre-sale launchpad feature allowing you to get your token on the market faster.

Each token is created, completes pre-sale and then is moved to a Uniswap v2 liquidity pool with all the LP locked forever making your tokens unruggable.
